Price: $235.99

_Vendor: Amazon_ <br />
_Keywords: tiltable solar panels_ <br />

Description: A lightweight, foldable solar panel array that can be used for small things such as camping, hiking, and other outdoor activities requiring small space.

**Positive Voice:**

_“Fold out legs were weak but OK, I read the other reviews first and expected that. Lying flat was easiest but legs do work just difficult to get to work”_

**Need:** More stable legs

_“Very sleek and portable solar panel.”_

**Need:** Ease of setup and portability


**Negative Voice:**

_“I purchased three of these panels. I have used them twice camping. The material on both panels that make contact with the ground is already showing signs of ware.
The panels should have had some type of hardcover where they make contact with the ground. It's obvious there will be issues down the road with fabric on bottom of panel"_

**Need:** Durable materials

_“I really wanted to like this product but the shipping was slower than expected and now to top it off on a full sun day I can't even get near the rated power highest I've seen is 133watts which is unacceptable for a 200w panel in my opinion and anytime it goes over 50watts the voltage tanks to 15 or 16v not being able to get close to its rated voltage is what's holding the overall power output back for the most part.”_

**Need:** Meets listed specification, Low cost-to-usage.

**2.) ECO-WORTHY Solar Panel Dual Axis Tracking System** <br />

Price: $549.99
Keywords: solar panel trackr <br />
Vendor: Amazon <br />
Description: Kit for attaching solar panels to a mount that is capable of following light throughout the day automatically.

**Positive Voice:**

_“I got the tracker about a month ago to power our air conditioning during the summer months. Absolutely love it. Other than the concrete pad it was placed one and wiring the panels, I had it assembled in few hours with minimal frustration. Only frustration was that the bolts use larger hex wrenches which are not included. This resulted in a trip to harbor freight. The default settings on the tracking computer works great. I just hooked it up and left it as is. Been working great for weeks. We plan to expand our array to a power the house completely off-grid and plan to buy a few more of these in the future as we grow.”_

**Need:** Quick assembly

_“This item is just as described. Tracks and follows the sun. Quality is way better than expected. I put 6 panels on it and it still had frame work sticking out. Instead of trimming it. I ordered 3 more panels. It has 9 panels on it. 7 go to my battery bank and the other 2 go to the batteries I installed for the unit it's self. Which is a little over kill. The thing barley uses any power to run. I used 12in concrete sonotube in the ground to mount it. Worked perfectly. 3ft in the ground and 1ft above. It isn't going anywhere. And it comes with all the hardware. From concrete anchors to mounting panels. I'm vary impressed with it.”_

**Need:** Works out-of-the-box, sturdy frame, supports large quantities of panels

**Negative Voice:**

_“Works great until it breaks. I’ve gone through 4 actuators now they just keep breaking. The software is 0% user friendly and the instructions for set up are awful. The directions actually state the wrong way to set up a few parts which I found several YouTube videos with other users stating this as well…. Lots of room for improvement, unfortunately”_

**Need:** All required components present, User friendly UI, Long mechanical lifespan
