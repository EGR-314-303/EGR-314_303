Price: $235.99

_Vendor: Amazon_ <br />
_Keywords: tiltable solar panels_ <br />

Description: A lightweight, foldable solar panel array that can be used for small things such as camping, hiking, and other outdoor activities requiring small space.

**Positive Voice:**

_“Fold out legs were weak but OK, I read the other reviews first and expected that. Lying flat was easiest but legs do work just difficult to get to work”_

**Need:** More stable legs

_“Very sleek and portable solar panel.”_

**Need:** Ease of setup and portability


**Negative Voice:**

_“I purchased three of these panels. I have used them twice camping. The material on both panels that make contact with the ground is already showing signs of ware.
The panels should have had some type of hardcover where they make contact with the ground. It's obvious there will be issues down the road with fabric on bottom of panel"_

**Need:** Durable materials

_“I really wanted to like this product but the shipping was slower than expected and now to top it off on a full sun day I can't even get near the rated power highest I've seen is 133watts which is unacceptable for a 200w panel in my opinion and anytime it goes over 50watts the voltage tanks to 15 or 16v not being able to get close to its rated voltage is what's holding the overall power output back for the most part.”_

**Need:** Meets listed specification, Low cost-to-usage.

**2.) ECO-WORTHY Solar Panel Dual Axis Tracking System** <br />

Price: $549.99
Keywords: solar panel trackr <br />
Vendor: Amazon <br />
Description: Kit for attaching solar panels to a mount that is capable of following light throughout the day automatically.

**Positive Voice:**

_“I got the tracker about a month ago to power our air conditioning during the summer months. Absolutely love it. Other than the concrete pad it was placed one and wiring the panels, I had it assembled in few hours with minimal frustration. Only frustration was that the bolts use larger hex wrenches which are not included. This resulted in a trip to harbor freight. The default settings on the tracking computer works great. I just hooked it up and left it as is. Been working great for weeks. We plan to expand our array to a power the house completely off-grid and plan to buy a few more of these in the future as we grow.”_

**Need:** Quick assembly

_“This item is just as described. Tracks and follows the sun. Quality is way better than expected. I put 6 panels on it and it still had frame work sticking out. Instead of trimming it. I ordered 3 more panels. It has 9 panels on it. 7 go to my battery bank and the other 2 go to the batteries I installed for the unit it's self. Which is a little over kill. The thing barley uses any power to run. I used 12in concrete sonotube in the ground to mount it. Worked perfectly. 3ft in the ground and 1ft above. It isn't going anywhere. And it comes with all the hardware. From concrete anchors to mounting panels. I'm vary impressed with it.”_

**Need:** Works out-of-the-box, sturdy frame, supports large quantities of panels

**Negative Voice:**

_“Works great until it breaks. I’ve gone through 4 actuators now they just keep breaking. The software is 0% user friendly and the instructions for set up are awful. The directions actually state the wrong way to set up a few parts which I found several YouTube videos with other users stating this as well…. Lots of room for improvement, unfortunately”_

**Need:** All required components present, User friendly UI, Long mechanical lifespan

**3.) KEYESTUDIO DIY Solar Tracking Electronic Kit for Arduino** <br />
![Keyes](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/61cdb82d-48ed-4873-802c-f4649a85f48b)

Price: $69.99
_Keywords: solar panel tracket_ <br />
_Vendor: Amazon_ <br />
Description: A DIY kit to make a small-scale solar panel tracker that works with an Arduino.

**Positive Voice:**

_“Had one issue with a BH1750 sensor and the company got back to me pretty quickly and helped me fix the problem. Great customer support.”_
**Need:** Good customer support.

_“Comes with all hardware and tools to entertain yourself and learn a ton. The instructions are clear and it is easier than it looks, but Google is your friend. High quality gift or hobbyist package.”_
**Need:** Easy-to-understand instructions. High-quality materials.

**Negative Voice:**

_“This product does not track the sun. I looked into the code. The code and the design of the device are not designed to track the sun. There are 4 sensors on a "fixed" baseboard. The solar panel is designed to move until the pairs of sensors located at the opposite ends receive the same light. But this should not track the sun because the light received by the sensors does not change by the movement of the solar panel."_

**Need:** Works as advertised.

_“Didn’t come with 3.7v rechargeable battery—a necessary component for operation. Also the provided code does work even after installing the appropriate libraries. I don’t know C++ very well and it will take a long time to figure out. Got this to learn in a fun way, did not expect to have to write the code myself. It does have quality components and the metal and acrylic structure is nice. Could’ve been really cool”_

**Need:** Does not require secondary knowledge


_“Its a good kit for all levels. The only complaint is the battery holder it came with is not standard AA or AAA. Apparently it is made for an 18650 style which is much larger than a standard AA battery. The Kit does not include this battery. The online instructions are fairly easy to follow and the kit is very simple construction."_

**Need:** Uses more standardized components

**4.) SUNER POWER 12V Solar Battery Charger Maintainer**

![Suner](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e99a977f-035e-4ff2-a519-9ff7a293e580)

Price: $59.95
_Keywords: small solar panel charger_ <br />
_Vendor: Amazon_ <br />
Description: Small 12V solar panel charger for low-voltage charging applications such as car, boat, or RV batteries.

**Positive Voice:**
_“Easy to install with the helpful brackets that allow angle adjustments for optimization in facing the sun. Have it mounted on the swim ladder at the rear of a sailboat stored out of the water for the winter. Needed to purchase an extension to run the wire to two large 12-volt marine batteries connected in parallel. Checked back after a week and the batteries are fully charged, as indicated by the solid green LED on the back of the panel and verified with a multimeter. I like the simplicity of the included controller that shows either solid or blinking red or green. These batteries are quite costly. Hopefully they will be maintained through the cold lengthy winter, enabling me to avoid the need to remove the heavy batteries and take them home each season.”_

**Need:** Easy to read data, Manually adjustable, Saves time

**Negative Voice:**

_“First unit was damaged in shipping, and returned before I ever received it. Second unit showed up and I could see why units get damaged in shipping nothing protecting the panel itself. To my surprise unit did work for the first two weeks. Went back to my trailer that’s parked for the season to see how the unit was doing keeping my batteries charged. It’s blinking green batteries are barely at 2/3 charged it’s in perfect direct sunlight and now it won’t charge anything. Messaged for support Frank emailed me back kept asking me if it’s in the shade, if it had a load put on it etc etc etc third email in I stated I’m sorry for being redundant but this thing was working great for two weeks it’s in direct sunlight the batteries are dying and I tried everything you said. Emails stopped and now nothing from them. I even bought the asurion warranty for it they stated they can’t do anything because my purchase is still so new and I need to contact them first. now I have my trailer in storage for the winter and no panel to keep my batteries charged….”_

**Need:** Longevity of product

_“I bought this charger to keep my Jeep battery topped off because I only drive it occasionally, and because it has electronics that draw a small current the battery will go dead after sitting for 6 or 8 weeks at a time. I had this plugged into the battery for 3 weeks and yesterday I unplugged it and tried to crank the Jeep. It was totally dead. I put my regular battery charger on it and charged it up overnight and drove the Jeep today. When I got to work the battery was swollen and spewing steam. This charger has destroyed my battery by overcharging it ! Not real happy about that. I new better than buy anything else made in China but it looked like it would be okay. I would strongly recommend not purchasing this. I am going to try to get my money back but I'm sure they won't replace my battery. GRRRR…”_

**Need:** Does not impact other items

_“Took it out of the box put it in the sun, tested in voltage got 12.5v. Went to mount the panel on the boat lift while tightening the wing nut on the adjustable ball mount the stud on one end broke. Mounted the mount base directly to the support bracket had to add extra holes so it would stop pivoting. Got it all hooked up to the battery get a green light everything is good. Next day getting nothing but a flashing red light(meaning it’s not charging the battery) the battery has not been used or hooked up to anything else since the day before. So I retest the panel now I’m getting a reading between 10.54v and -.06v”_ 

**Need:** Product made-to-order


**5.) SolarX V2: Sun-Tracking Solar Panel DIY Kit**

![solarx](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e4166b35-3641-4c2b-a936-bfa5854a56eb)

Price: $49.99
_Keywords: Mini Solar Panel Tracker_<br />
_Vendor: Amazon_<br />
Description: Miniature robotic kit that produces its energy and follows any light source. It’s simple to assemble and comes with a manual book to help customers in controlling and constructing the device.

**Positive Voice:**
_“I wanted to start getting into solar panel projects but didn’t know where to start. It’s a bit overwhelming trying to learn a few skill set but after getting my hands on this sun-tracking solar panel kit, I felt much more equip to do larger projects. This kit is awesome! It has everything you need to complete the sun-tracker, which worked very well. The instructions were easy to follow and I was really proud of it in the end. It was my first time working with most of the components of the kit. Highly recommended for anyone looking to get into solar stuff, and for children who are curious about renewable energy.”_

**Need:** Make our product where it can also aim at the goal of being educational.

_“This is a fun and useful project that allows anyone building it to understand how "follow the sun" solar panels work. Kit is complete with my only request would be to include a couple of wrenches to properly tighten the hex stand offs to the project base. Everything is nicely bagged and identified and the instructions are clear on how to assemble. ENJOYABLE! GOOD PRODUCT!”_

**Need:** Make our product engaging to learn with and build.

_“This solar tracker kit aimed to pique my daughter's interest in STEM, particularly as she explores engineering concepts in high school. The kit's focus on assembly, building, and scientific exploration aligns well with her academic interests. The components themselves are well-organized, with labeled bags and pre-cut wooden pieces for ease of assembly. Additionally, the inclusion of spare parts caters to potential mishaps during construction. These aspects make the kit user-friendly for students. However, a major shortcoming lies in the included instructions. They lack crucial steps and information, making them incomplete and difficult to follow. My daughter primarily relied on reference images and videos to complete the assembly process. Clear instructions are essential for an educational kit, as they guide students through the learning process and ensure successful project completion.”_

**Need:** Provide spare parts 

**Negative Voice:** 

_“I was real excited about that little project! All the components look really good and quality made. I was at the step where the servo motors get build in and was wondering why there is a gap.(see picture) I’m pretty sure they updated their servos but didn’t change the design. Those servos do not fit that design. So unless they change the design or servos, it’s basically not working. Otherwise I would give more stars!”_

**Need:** Make the design consistent and measurable to their appropriate components.


_“Building the SolarX V2 with my son felt like a promising venture into the world of solar STEM projects. The kit itself boasts quality materials that give it a sturdy feel right out of the box, which is always a plus when you're handling electronic components.
However, we hit a snag with the instructions—they were pretty challenging to follow. It seemed like they skipped crucial steps, leaving us puzzled more than once. Despite our best efforts, our finished product didn't function as advertised. It was supposed to track the sun, but ours sadly stayed still, which was a letdown, especially since my son was really looking forward to seeing it in action. For those of you who are adept at circuitry and perhaps can navigate poorly laid-out guides better than we did, this kit might still be a hit. For us, it was a mixed bag: great quality and educational potential, but marred by frustrating instructions. Here's hoping the company takes note and improves the manuals—this kit has a lot of potential waiting to be unlocked.”_

**Need:** Make the constructions coherent.

_“I really like the idea behind this. I also like how they have put together some nice components. Each item is placed nicely in labeled bags so they are easy to find. The wood pieces are laser cut and easy to separate. There is even extra parts in case you lose or break something. Once completed, it does a fair job of tracking the sun and cold even be made in to a full scale working system. To assemble this, I unboxed everything and grabbed the instructions and went to work. Everything went together pretty easily. I did have a few problems with the wooden pieces fitting together and had to use some sandpaper to sand down some of the tabs. But everything else worked great and went together without a problem. At the end of the instructions is a QR code to download the programming code and learning booklet. It took you to a site that didn’t have the source code and said click here for the learning booklet. The link didn’t work. Frustrated, I then went back to the Amazon page and found the booklet there. The instructions in the Amazon booklet were a lot different then what was included with the kit. The instructions included with the kit were incomplete and left out some very vital steps and information. DO NOT USE THE INCLUDED INSTRUCTIONS. This is why I took off 2 stars. As an educational kit, the instructions MUST be correct and complete. Once I downloaded the source code and fixed my build errors, everything worked great. Note: I later saw the back page cover of the instructions did have a good QR code for the source code and booklet.”_

**Need:** Provide relatable sources that deal with the technology, programming, and science of the device.
