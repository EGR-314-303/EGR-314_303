title: Team 303 Charter
---

## Team Goals <br />
For goals, our group would like to: <br />
* Broaden our understanding by using the course’s required tools such as ECAD and board mounting, engaging with the products of sensors and actuator subsystems, and using wifi communication with our future project.
* Make a product that is effective and can uphold the usage of the required subsystems.
* Improve or create skills in the language of C programming as well as Python that will be necessary for our project
* Become organized and on track with our checkpoints based on the progress of this course’s final project and keep pushing our limits with what we can do.

## Product Mission Statement <br />
Our mission is to create an environment sensing and adjusting product that can be useful to most everyday people and fulfills all the project requirements within the budget we have been given.

## Communication Channels

| Name | First Channel | Second Channel | Third Channel |
| ---- | ------------- | -------------- | ------------- |
| Tim Drafz | _Discord_ | _Phone/Text_ | _Email_ |
| Alex Leon | _Discord_ | _Text_ | _Email_ |
| Sivanee Naghichetty | _Discord_ | _Phone/Text_ | _Email_ |
| Luke Jeffs | _Discord_ | _Phone/Text_ | _Email_ |

## Communication Procedures <br />
Our team will coordinate via Discord primarily as a means of disseminating information or meeting to discuss what needs to be completed. 
Backup communication will happen if the former fails to work or if a member is unable to use the program at a given time. 
For certain portions of the project that require the group to be in person, we will coordinate on Discord to come up with a time that works for everyone to meet. 
For correspondence with the instructor, either to or from the group, the meeting leader will act as the liaison.

## Meeting Schedule & Coordination <br />
The availability of the group can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1M7a3bRtry3gzHTWpnxGkQDdC6XeBn9dR/edit?gid=1073949456#gid=1073949456).
The general idea for our group is that we will meet on Saturday and Sunday from 1000 to 1200. 
This will be over Discord so we don’t have to physically go somewhere to meet. 
If we need to meet in person specifically, we are all available to meet directly after class on Monday and Wednesday as well.

## Roles and Responsibilities

| Role | Name | Duties |
| ---- | ---- | ------ |
| Meeting leader | Tim | Schedules team meetings, creates and distributes an agenda for each meeting, and runs each meeting |
| Meeting recorder | Luke | Takes minutes of each team meeting, including  attendance, and records action items and to whom they  are assigned |
| Assignment leader | Alex | Coordinates the team’s work on a given assignment to Canvas before the due date |
| Project monitor | Sivanee | Tracks the team’s progress relative to the project schedule (Gantt chart) and keeps team members apprised of deadlines and project status |


**How will you assign technical responsibilities to the team members?** <br />
1. How will we ensure assignments are submitted before deadlines and each team member has “signed off” on each assignment?
  * Whoever is assigned the role of Assignment Leader will ensure that assignments are turned in on time.

2. How will we ensure that each team member has the knowledge and skill required for each assignment, and how you will adjust if not?
  * We should be open about our skills and inform others for guidance on certain material that may be deemed difficult for peers so that they may be able to build up their skills.

3. How will we ensure that feedback from your design review is distributed to and acted on by every of the team?
  * It may be beneficial to bring the return of our reviews at the coming of our available team meetings.

4. How will we address missed contributions/assignments/actions?
  * If there has been an issue in turning items into the course, we will address the instructor the matter and ask for any possible extensions.

5. How will we hold one another accountable to the expectations described in this charter?
  * A member will be assigned a specific task for the benefit of our final project, and if they provide low expectations the team will address the matter personally to try and maintain an organized and on-track path.

6. How will we recognize that a team member is underperforming?
  * We can easily recognize if a team member is underperforming if they are not upholding their positions and based on any contribution they have performed during our course.

7. How will we help an underperforming team member improve?
  * We would first address the matter and then we will discuss what needs to be done with the underperforming member and to try and assist them.

8. What are the consequences if an underperforming team member does not improve?
  * Team members who consistently do not improve and underperform will be reported to the professor so that we can address the problem with both our team and the teaching staff.

## Conflict Recognition & Resolution <br />
Conflicts often tend to happen when there is no clarity or communication.
In our team, we aim to promote inclusivity where each team member reports what they do and asks for feedback. 
We also want to be open for a chat about any conflicts a team member is facing during the project or progression. 
If a conflict occurs despite the above precautions we would discuss it within our team to find a solution that works for all parties. 
If a team member isn't participating a fair share or is no longer responding then we reach out to the professor.
